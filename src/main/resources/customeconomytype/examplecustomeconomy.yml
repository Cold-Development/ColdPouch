# This is an example of a custom economy
# The expected behaviour is for this to be a pouch containing diamonds, rather than money,
#   however you can use this feature to make this plugin compatible with any economy plugin,
#   as long as there is a command to give money.
#
# The name of this file (excluding the YML extension) is the id of the economy,
#   and must be alphanumeric with no spaces and unique.
# The command below will be executed when a player opens a pouch of this economy, 
#   replace %player% with the player and %prize% with the reward.
transaction-prize-command: "give %player% diamond %prize%"

# You can configure the prefixes/suffixes the normal way in the main config
